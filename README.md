# Reports API Overview

## JOIN Types Explained

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows with matching keys in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table, plus matches from the right (NULL if no match).
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table, plus matches from the left (NULL if no match).
- **FULL OUTER JOIN (emulated)**: Combines LEFT and RIGHT JOIN to include all rows from both tables.
- **CROSS JOIN**: Returns every possible combination of rows from both tables.
- **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table to itself to relate rows within that table.
